# Final-Project
The file named "Network Configurations" in this repository is considered as the artefact of project.

The 3 scenarios have been configured with different levels of security and were used to analyse the change in network performance. 

Configurations for ALL Scenarios

    To set up scenarios:
      
        1. clear running configurations on devices
        2. enter the configuration terminal 
        3. copy and past the corresponding configuration 
        
    Make sure to copy the config from after it says "Current Configurations: **** bytes"
